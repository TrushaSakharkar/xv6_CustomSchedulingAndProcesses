# xv6 Custom Scheduling and Processes.

To run this you need to install qemu first.
After getting it installed do the following:
```
make
make qemu-nox
```

Also use the following command to make the folder clean again before compiling again:
```
make clean
```

To exit from non-graphical qemu (qemu-nox):
```
Ctrl+A x
```

### User syscalls:

##### ps:
Prints the pid, status, and priority of all processes.

##### xpri pid pri:
Changes priority of process with PID = `pid` to `pri`

##### new:
Crates new parent-child process that takes quite a long time to execute.

##### pinfo:
Prints `pid`, `runtime`, `number of runs` and `current queue` of all active/inuse processes.

### Other syscalls:

##### waitx:
Returns `wait time` and `run time` of the process.
Its just extension of predefined `wait syscall` but with two more arguments for returning the `wait time` and `run time` of process.

### Custom scheduling:

Default scheduler for xv6 is `ROUND ROBIN`, and to use this scheduler no new CLARG is to be passed.

For other schedulers following format should be used:
```
make qemu-nox SCHEDULER=VALUE
```
Where `VALUE` is:
```
DEFAULT : For Round Robin
FCFS    : For FCFS
PBS     : For Priority based
MLFQ    : For MLFQ scheduling
```

### Implementations:

#### FCFS:
During the development of waitx, three more attributes namely `ctime`, `rtime` and `etime` denoting creation time, run time, end time were created.
So for FCFS we look for process with smallest `ctime`.

Also this scheduling implemented here is non-preemptive. To implement this, we compare the `ctime` of currently running process, and that of smallest `ctime` and preemp only when the second is smaller than first.

#### PBS:
Similar to FCFS but here comparing `priority` attribute of the process (Added to implement this). Default priority is set to `60`, lower the value of this attribute higher is the Process priority. Max value is set to 100.
To change the priority of a process use `xpri` user syscall.

#### MLFQ:
The procedure is as follows:

1. On the initiation of a process, push it to the end of the highest priority queue.
2. The highest priority queue should be run always, if not empty.
3. If the process completes, it leaves the system.
4. If the process used the complete time slice assigned for its current priority
queue, it is pre-empted and â€‹ inserted at the end of the next lower level queue.
5. If a process voluntarily relinquishes control of the CPU, it leaves the queuing
network, and when the process becomes ready again after the I/O, it is
inserted at the tail of the same queue, from which it is relinquished earlier.
6. A round-robin scheduler should be used for processes at the lowest priority
queue.
7. To prevent starvation, implemented the aging :-
   - If the wait time of a process in lower priority queues exceeds a given limit(assign a suitable limit to prevent starvation), their priority is increased and they are pushed to the next higher priority queue.
   - The wait time is defined as the difference between the current time and the time at which the process was last executed.
